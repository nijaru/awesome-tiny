# Contribution Guidelines
We welcome any additions you have. Please open a pull request if you have a good link to share or want to update any current links.

## Links
This is the core of the project and what most people will be adding to. Please add links that meet the following

- Adds a link to a guide for a proof of concept project
- Preferably small projects, but longer projects with plenty of comments or a guide are allowed as well 
- Contains enough resources for a reader to follow along and implement it themselves
    - This can be through reading the code itself or a blog post, etc.

### Comments
One thing that needs some help currently is comments on the initial links. I will most likely take care of this myself, but any help would be appreciated.


## Maintenance
Help with managing pull requests and keeping links up to date is greatly appreciated. Please reach out to @nijaru (@nijaru0x on twitter) if you would like to help.
